    <li><strong>Automated Processing / Profiling:</strong> We may use automated tools, including AI, to sort Offers by relevance, detect spam submissions, generate trend insights, and assist with internal suggestions. Such processing does not make legally binding decisions about you; you may request human review by contacting us.</li>
